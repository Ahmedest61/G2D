GTAVision is an open-source tool which enables computer vision researchers to collect the dataset from Grand Theft Auto V. With the capability of accessing to the native functions of the game, researchers could directly interact with the tool while playing the game. In addition, researchers could gather the images rendered by the gameplay camera as well as its exact camera pose within the game coordinate.
